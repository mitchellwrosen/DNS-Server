Move RR into its own file
Make DnsQuery shallow (not going to cache it)
Work on cache (contains RRs). Going to be a <domain name, RR> tuple, where
   domain name is in DNS format (0x03 www 0x06 google 0x03 com)
Deep copy every RR because they will *all* be cached
Timers to decrement TTL of cache

Things I can put off:
Multiple clients
IPv6
